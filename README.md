   # Time Series of Precipitaion in SÃ£o Paulo

This project is the culmination of my undergradutate thesis for my bachelor in Computer Engineer. 

I used the data avaiable on BDMEP, which is the database for INMET, both from conventional and automatic soucers to eliminate
missing values. 30 years from the data set were analyzed and used to create the model, the last 2 were used to compare against
the predict values.

The project is divided in two parts:

1. Analysis of the historical series components: trend, sesonality, auto-correlation and other factor.

2. Modeling a forecast model based on the time series using ARIMA.
